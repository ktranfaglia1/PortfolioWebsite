    <h2> Work and Experience </h2>
    <div class="p3"> 
      <div class="list"> 
        <li> Mathematics and Computer Science Tutor, September 2022 - May 2025 </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> In the Math Emporium at the Salisbury University, I hosted an open door tutoring center that provides a focused, studious, and welcoming environment for all undergraduate students. My goal was to expand student's problem solving skillsets and improve their overall understanding of the course material. As a tutor, I guided students through problems and constrcuted on-the-spot mini lessons to reiterate and reinforce course material. I tutored all 100 and 200 level Math and Computer Science courses and occassionally Physics, Chemistry, and Business courses. For over 10 courses, I tutored approximately 10 to 20 students per week, which totals about 1260 students. </li> 
          </ul> 
        </ul>
        <li> Computer Science Lab Assistant, September 2024 - December 2024 </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> Once a week for one lab session, I assisted a Computer Science 117: Programming Fundamentals course at Salisbury University. My objective was to improve the average performance for the course by offering free assistance on the course material. As a lab assistant, I floated around the lab room to answer questions regarding the lab assignment, review code, and aid students through programming difficulties. Additionally, I held two office hours per week in which students came for tutoring and/or coding assistance for the course. Overall, I assisted 28 students and improved the average course GPA by 10% for the given professor. </li> 
          </ul> 
        </ul>
        <li> Calculus I Supplimental Instructor, September 2022 - December 2022 </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> Every class period, which was four days a week, I attended a Calculus I lecture with the same professor and class for the entire semester. During the lecture, I reviewed the material to refresh myself and construct a lesson plan catered toward the current topic. I also had a one and a half hours of office time for lesson plan construction. Then, for three hours a week, split into two sections, I hosted a study session in which I lectured to a classroom of students and led group discussions. My goal was to avoid direct lecturing and establish an interactive environment in which students discuss and collaberatively work through problems with my guidance to strengthen their mathematical skillsets. Overall, my sessions increased the course pass rate by 20% for students that attended. </li> 
          </ul>

    <h2> Research Projects </h2>
    <div class="p3"> 
      <div class="list"> 
        <li> Visualization of Sound | Music Painter, January 2023 - February 2024 </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> With guidance from a facualty mentor and in collaberation with an undergraduate studying mathematics, I developed a downloadable software in Python, using PySide/PyQt, sound-device, and PyAudio interfaces, that reads the data of a wav file and converts it to a list of dominate frequencies and spectral data. This data is then used to create a 2-D graphical image using simple geometric shapes, hence giving a single image for the entire clip. The project aimed to research and formulate a product that could take any audio file in wav format, including locally captured live recording, and make it more tangible by constructing a  graphical representation. This project was inspired by a vision of music as an artform, and so, we created 13 different algorithms to transform audible art into visual art. </li> 
          </ul> 
        </ul>
        <li> Discrete Mathematical Systems | Cellular Automata, February 2024 - December 2024 </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> I led a team of three undergraduate software engineers, including myself, to produce a collection of cellular automata simulators for a client. The client was a professor specializing their research in discrete mathematical systems and desired a simulation toolset in the form of a web-application. I was the team leader and both a front-end and back-end developer for the project. My role as team leader entailed organizing and leading team meetings, contacting and arranging meetings with our client, assigning roles and weekly responsibilities, creating weekly and quarterly agendas, assigning and prioritizing tasks, managing team progression, and reporting updates to our client. Additionally, I was the sole front-end developer such that I was responsible for the entire UI design and implementation, and I constructed back-end functionality for the application. Overall, the client was overwhelmingly satisfied with the product and utilized it to enhance their research.  </li> 
          </ul> 
        </ul>
        <li> Laridae - Undergraduate Research Journal, Volume 4, February 2022 - July 2022 </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> As a project of personal interest, I wrote an interdisciplinary research paper titled, "Capitalism: The Synthesis of Economic Growth and Climate Change." The paper contains nearly 6000 words and utilizes 22 academic sources to support an argumentative thesis on the role of capitalism in climate change. The final product was submitted to Salisbury University's Laridae - Undergraduate Research Journal as an application to have the work featured in the fourth volume. Among the 31 original submissions, this scholarly article was accepted to be one of the 13 entires. </li>

    <h2> Community Involvement </h2>
    <div class="p3"> 
      <div class="list"> 
        <li> 3rd Annual Eastern Shore High School Computer Programming Competition, 03/13/2024 </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> At the ESHSCPC hosted by Salisbury University, I volunteered as a competition moderator and advisor. Prior to the competition, I was responsible for setting up the computers and administering logins. During the two hour programming portion, I moderated over 20 competitors to prevent cheating, and I answered questions and provided technical assistance as needed. Afterwards, I gave a 45 minute presentation in which I presented some of my projects, gave insight into being a computer science student, provided tips for succeeding in academia, and finally, hosted a Q&A. </li>

        <li> Parsons Cemetery Clean-up, 04/02/2022  </li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> At Parsons Cemetery in Salisbury, Maryland, I attened a cemetery clean-up hosted by the Clarke Honors College at Salisbury University. During this 5 hour session, I helped remove trash, clear debris, and discard old decorations to prepare for Spring. Overall, I helped clean the entire 18 acre cemetery, serving to maintain the enriching history of the land and preserve a site honoring over 1300 interred veterans and thousands of other honorable citizens.  </li>

        <li> Jaycee's Christmas Shopping Tour, 12/11/2021</li> 
        <ul> 
          <ul>
            <li> Before Christmas, I volunteered to help the Salisbury Jaycees with their annual Children's Christmas Shopping Tour. During the 4 hour event, I recieved a wish list for three different children and picked out gifts for them. My task was to stay within a particular budget and try to balance buying needs and wants for the child. Overall, with funding from Jaycee, I was able to provide gifts for three children in need.</li>
