   <p4> Getting Started </p4> <br>
   <p5> Opening a Wav File </p5> <br>
   <p6> For your convenience, there are five ways to open a Wav File <br> 
   <b> 1) </b> Click "File" in the top-left corner. Then, select "Open Wav File..." next to the yellow folder icon. Navigate your directory and double click a Wav file to open it <br>
   <b> 2) </b> Locate the yellow folder icon in the first quadrant of the primary tool bar. Click the icon, then navigate your directory and double click a Wav file to open it <br>
   <b> 3) </b> Use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + O. Navigate your directory and double click a Wav file to open it <br>
   <b> 4) </b> Locate the light yellow "Open Directory" button on the right-center region of the secondary tool bar. Click the button and select a folder of Wav files. All the Wav files in the folder will be listed in the "File Choice" drop down bar and it will automatically open the first Wav file in the folder. Only Wav files will be included in the drop down list <br>
   <b> 5) </b> Click and Drag. Navigate your directory and select a Wav file or a folder containing Wav files. Click the folder or file and drag it over any area within the application and drop it. If a single Wav file, it will be opened and ready to begin rendering images. If a folder of Wav files, it will open the directory just as if you used the "open directory" button such that it will list all the Wav files in the "File Choice" drop down bar and automatically open the first Wav file in the folder
   </p6>
   <p5> User Customization Tools </p5>
   <p6> The user customization tool bar is the secondary tool bar. This is a movable tool bar that can dock in the North or South regions or outside of the application; just click and drag the top light-blue bar. There are a few tools at your disposal. Before you render a file, set the algorithm and chunk size by clicking the drop down bars. The chunk size refers to the number of samples grouped together in a single unit and determines how much data is used to render an image. Lower chunk size values use more data per sample unit and higher values use less. The right most button labled "Background Color" brings up a color picker that will change the canvas color. If you change the background color with an image on the canvas, the image will not be overwritten. The left most button titled "Clear Image" wil clear the canvas but keep the background color. Also available is the "Open Directory" buton to select a folder of Wav files from your device. All the Wav files in the folder will be listed in the "File Choice" drop down bar and it will automatically open the first Wav file in the folder </p6>
   <p5> Render Tools </p5>
   <p6> All render tools are located in the first quadrant of the primary tool bar <br> Render: denoted with a paintbrush icon. This will render the file immediately. There will be no progression of the image, only the final product will be displayed <br> Render and Play: denoted with a play icon. The image will be slowly rendered as if being drawn on the canvas.

   <br> <br> <center> <p3> Frequently Asked Questions </p3> </center>
   <p5> What is a Wav file? </p5>
   <p6> A Wav file is retrospectively, a rather large file of uncompressed audio data. It was developed by Microsoft and IBM to store an audio bitstream. Since Wav files are uncompressed, they work better for data extraction as less information is lost and condensed in compression </p6>
   <p5> Can I Use MP3 files or sound files not in a Wav format? </p5>
   <p6> Unfortunately, no. The data extraction and analytics system used in the software only functions properly with a Wav formatting, so the application will only open Wav files. However, you can convert any standard audio file to a Wav file. There are many free online and desktop based applications to convert audio files. We recommend using Audacity or CloudConvert </p6>
   <p5> Can you render multiple files at the same time? </p5>
   <p6> You can not render multiple files at the same time but you can render images over top one another to create the same product. You can also have multiple files open by selecting a directory to open, but only one file from the directory can be selected and ran at a time </p6>
   <p5> Can I customize the application? </p5>
   <p6> Yes! Both the primary and secondary tool bars can be moved and docked. You can click the twelve dots on the left of the primary tool bar and drag it anywhere, even outside of the application. The primary tool bar can be docked in the North, South, East, or West regions of the application. You can move the secondary tool bar with the user customization tools by clicking and draging anywhere on the top light-blue bar. It can be docked in the North or South regions only but it can be placed anywhere in or outside the application </p6>
   <p5> Does the application tell you what file you have open and selected? </p5>
   <p6> Yes! The selected file will always be shown at the very top of the application and it will display the directory path of the Wav file for your system. If you are using the open directory option, then the selected file will be highlighted in the "File Choice" drop down bar. It will also update the top directory as if a single Wav file was opened. Note that if you open a directory and then open a single Wav file not in the directory, the selected file will not appear in the "File Choice" drop down box. Still, the path for the selected file at very top of the application will be updated and display the currently selected file </p6>
   <p5> Are there other methods of viewing the images on the canvas? </p5>
   <p6> There are no alternative methods to viewing the canvas, however, you can move the canvas and zoom to better observe the artwork. You can click and drag the canvas to move and zoom with a scroll wheel on a mouse or with two fingers on a trackpad </p6>
   <br> <br> <center> <p3> Unexpected Problems </p3> </center>
   <p4> Program Crashes &amp; Performance Issues </p4>
   <br> <p5> Overloading the Render </p5>
   <p6> Overloading the render will cause the program to slow down and become laggy until it eventually becomes non-responsive or crashes. Overloading the render is caused by quickly switching between algorithms or trying to render other algorithms or files before the previous render finished </p6>
   <br> <p5> Overwhelming the Canvas </p5>
   <p6> Simply having too much on the canvas can cause performance issues or crashes. The more algorithms you run without clearing the canvas, the more delayed it will be if you try to move the image. We recommend limiting the amount of renders that you do without clearing the canvas, especially with the algorithms utilizing triangles </p6>
   <p5> Prolonged Recording &amp; Large Files </p5>
   <p6> The longer that data is streamed in and used to construct an image on the canvas, the more strain there is on the application and the device. The amount of time a recording should be limited to depends on the algorithm, but most of them can handle long recordings. For the triangle algorithms, we recommend limiting the length of a recording, or choosing a higher chunk size. This applies to live recordings and opening Wav files </p6> <br>
