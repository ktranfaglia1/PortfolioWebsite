      <li> Classification and Analysis of Collision and Contact Sports, October 2024 - December 2024 </li>  
      <ul> 
        <li> With a team of three undergraduate data scientists, including myself, I conducted a comprehensive data-driven analysis to redefine the classification of sports as “collision” or “contact” based on Repeated Head Impact (RHI) exposure. This project involved extensive data filtering, cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis of multiple datasets containing behavioral, EEG-derived neural markers, and cognitive performance measures. Using machine learning techniques, I applied clustering and classification modeling to identify distinct patterns of RHI exposure across different sports. By integrating EEG signal analysis and cognitive task performance data, I developed predictive models to assess long-term neurological risks associated with varying levels of impact exposure. This research provides an objective framework for sports classification, offering a more rigorous, evidence-based approach to understanding RHI effects and informing athlete safety policies. </li>

      <li> Chess Openings and Elo: Patterns and Predictions of Game Outcomes, October 2024 - December 2024 </li>  
      <ul> 
        <li> I developed a Python program to clean, preprocess, and analyze a dataset of over six million chess games from Lichess.org, investigating the relationship between player Elo ratings, opening choices, and game outcomes. Through data-driven analysis, I identified key trends in opening preferences across different Elo groups and event types, revealing how strategic choices vary with player skill level. I also built predictive models, including logistic regression and random forest classifiers, to assess the effectiveness of Elo ratings and opening choices in forecasting game results. The analysis confirmed Elo difference as the strongest predictor of outcomes, while additional features provided limited improvements in accuracy. This research highlights the strengths and limitations of Elo-based predictions and the potential need for more contextual data to enhance chess outcome modeling. </li>
